      Ever been someplace so beautiful that it was hard for you to decide which
      of its sights was the prettiest? Well, that’s Kashmir for you. With each
      of its landscapes so breathtaking, it’s hard to not fall in love with the
      beauty of Kashmir valley. The mighty mountains, tall chinars, pristine
      lakes and rivers, and nicely manicured gardens are a few of the many
      things that adorn the Kashmir valley.
